    "1. What is Concurrency ? \n",
    "    - concurrency is simultaneous occurrence. In Python, the things that are occurring simultaneously are called by different names (thread, task, process) \n",
    "    - only multiprocessing actually runs these trains of thought at literally the same time. Threading and asyncio both run on a single processor and therefore only run one at a time.\n",
    "2. Difference between threading & Asyncio?\n",
    "   - The way the threads or tasks take turns is the big difference between threading and asyncio.\n",
    "   - In threading, the operating system actually knows about each thread and can interrupt it at any time to start running a different thread. This is called pre-emptive multitasking since the operating system can pre-empt your thread to make the switch.\n",
    "   - Asyncio, on the other hand, uses cooperative multitasking. The tasks must cooperate by announcing when they are ready to be switched out. That means that the code in the task has to change slightly to make this happen.\n",
    "   - Ony 1 CPU processor used for both threading & asyncio\n",
    "3. What is Parallelism?\n",
    "   -  A process here can be thought of as almost a completely different program, though technically they’re usually defined as a collection of resources where the resources include memory, file handles and things like that. One way to think about it is that each process runs in its own Python interpreter.\n",
    "   - Multi-processors of CPU used. \n",
